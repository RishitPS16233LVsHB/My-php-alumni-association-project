The alumni association system is developed for an institution for its alumnis to connect with the institution's faculties and have can connect with each other as well.
In this system there are 2 users:- admin and alumni member
Alumni member can do following:- create(post,event,job alert,chats(database based and very simple)),view(post,event,job alert,chats(database based and very simple),other alumni member's profile),manage there profile.
Admin or Coordinator isn't fully explored in this version sadly....it is done in the c# adaptation of the system.....
